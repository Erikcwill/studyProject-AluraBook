## Detalhes do projeto
 
# Responsiveness Study - Mobile First

This is a study project focused on responsive web development using the "mobile first" methodology. The goal is to simulate a real work environment, where I received a design model in Figma and had to develop the web version for mobile devices.

## What is the project?

The project consists of developing a responsive web page that adapts to different screen sizes, following the "mobile first" methodology. The entire layout was designed in Figma, and the challenge was to transform this design into a web page using HTML and CSS.

## How to access the project?

The project is available at the following link: [project link](https://study-project-alura-book.vercel.app/).

## Technologies used

For the development of the project, I used the following technologies:

-   HTML
-   CSS

## Mobile first methodology

The "mobile first" concept consists of developing the mobile version of a website before the desktop version. This means that the layout, structure, and content are designed with mobile devices in mind first, and then adapted for larger screens.

By using this methodology, it is possible to ensure that the page is responsive and adapts well to any device, as well as improving loading speed and user experience on mobile devices.

## Conclusion

This responsiveness study project was an excellent opportunity to practice my web development skills, especially using the mobile first methodology. With this project, I was able to learn more about designing and developing responsive and adaptable web pages for different devices.
